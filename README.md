# ros2-labs-07


## Description

- **docker_ws** folder: contains all the necessary docker files and scripts to build docker images.
- **ros_ws** folder: this folder will contain all the packages that we'll create. It is mapped inside our container with docker volumes. **WARNING: deleteme.md, it is there just to force git to create the ros_ws folder even if empty**.
- **chown_me.sh**: bash script to change the owner of files from root to user (just in case docker root user messes around with our files :) ).
- **run.sh**: bash script to run our container with all the capabilities and volumes that we need.
- **exec.sh**: bash script to open a shell to an already running container.
